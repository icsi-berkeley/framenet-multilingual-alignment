"""This package is part of the Multilingual FrameNet (MLFN) project. It consists of modules developed to support the alignment of FrameNets in many languages using various techniques.

Most of the functionality is divided into three parts: models definitions for FrameNet and alignment specific elements; database loaders that read .xml files with different schemas and instatiate models and the algorithms for alignment.
